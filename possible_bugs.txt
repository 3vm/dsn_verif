Possible bugs

cdc problems in analog to digital transfer - sample and hold

data === expected_data will pass when both data and expd are x. Need to add !$isunknown(data) to the check

Fractional PLL uses Moving Average filter as loop filter. This does not provide the phase compensation to keep the loop stable. Need to check.

RC phase shift oscillator uses C connected to ground but literature shows C in high pass mode, 2. each RC section is acting independently of the next (internal impedance contribution is missing)
