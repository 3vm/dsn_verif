Tom Young is a senior engineer recently assigned to a team designing chips for simulating protein folding. Tom has a PhD in electrical engineering, but, he is puzzled by the requirement to design logic for simulating biological stuff. He refers to an open library called BiochemHDL that has a large number of reference designs for biochemistry related problems. He is able to quickly deploy a working design and get his product to work in first pass of silicon.

Bala Daggula is an executive at Egde Logic Inc. He needs a design IP to preprocess DNA sequencing data coming out of a high throughput sequencer. Bala refers to a subscription based IP library and gets access to the latest algorithm for DNA sequence preprocessing. The best part is the subscription provider continuously updates and supports their IP as long as the subscription is active.

Greg Razavi is a design manager at Saitel looking for talented digital design engineers. He reforms his hiring process by removing the requirement for advanced degrees. Soon, he gets many highly talented applicants from various backgrounds and extremely eager to start work in their new roles. 

Ana Cortez is a professor in San Carlos university Argentina. She has limited access to actual job related material, she uses the educational material from Ehgu design ecosystem to expand and make her class more practically applicable. Some of her students team up and start a small design IP development startup.

Preface
--------

Electronic chips are now everywhere. There are chips deep in the Sahara desert, there are chips in space, there are chips inside the human body, there are chips deep in the ocean, there are chips inside cars, there are chips in rockets and there are chips in unimaginable places. But chip designers are only a tiny fraction of the world population and are also located only in a few selected pockets of the world. The headcount of chip designers is so small, it is a miracle they are able to make an out-sized impact on the world. Every piece of modern machine contains chips in one form or another. Our life in the information age is underpinned by chips.  Even at the current level of technology the value added by chips is immense. So immense that most of the world population depends on it for healthy, happy and prosperous living.
Suppose, I tell you the number of chip designers can be increased by a factor of 100x and the number of electronics systems designed by a factor of 1000x, what wonders would come to pass? Is it even possible? Oh, Yes! I think so.
Sadly, when older professions are fading away into history newer professions like chip design has a significant shortage of skilled people. Chip design is accessible to only a few people in the world. The design process is also far less efficient than what it can be. In this book,  I describe my ideas related to a hardware design ecosystem that is more efficient at producing useful hardware and also reward more people across the whole world. It is quite cumbersome to refer to hardware design engineers or ASIC design engineers or digital designers or RTL designers or IC designers or FPGA designers. It is also rather useless to add the term engineer to every job title. So,  I am naming this particular trade as chipping and the practitioner as a chipper.

Ehgu Proposal
--------------

Low cost education
-------------------

Create low cost education material that helps aspiring people to self learn and start contributing to the world of chipping.

Open Certification
------------------
Create a standardized certification process for chip design that is open to all. Revise the certification curriculum periodically, say, every three years.

Massive Value Creation
----------------------
Consider candidates certified through this process for jobs without asking for extra qualifications like degrees. Job specific extra skill requirements may be specified. Let people from varied backgrounds from across the world contribute to the electronics industry by providing open source reference design libraries, advanced software as a service, open process technology support files for design. Enjoy the massive value that gets created by a flood of new designs!

Proposed Certifications
-----------------------
Chipping has evolved into two natural specializations,  one for ASIC design and another for FPGA. There is a lot of overlap between the two,  but,  there is a lot of specific learning as well. So,  I am recommending three curriculums,  Chipper Basics,  Chipper ASIC and Chipper FPGA. The basics certification is to get anyone a simple job in the ecosystem quickly. Other certifications are for career growth.

Chipper Basics

FAQ
----
How can we support the Ehgu ecosystem?
You could start using open source code for your designs. You can donate code and documentation of your discontinued products. You can even open source your most important product to gain greater market credibility. You can remove the requirement for degree from your job postings. Try developing a curriculum for your company specific jobs that general public can self learn and then apply for your jobs. Chipping relies heavily on software tools. Some of the tools are prohibitively expensive. If you are a software developer creating Electronic Design Automation tools for design, try changing the model from a one time fully paid licensing to a Software as a Service model. Or better still, how about open sourcing your software?
