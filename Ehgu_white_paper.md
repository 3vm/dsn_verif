Preface
--------

Electronic chips are now everywhere. There are chips deep in the Sahara desert, there are chips in space, there are chips inside the human body, there are chips deep in the ocean, there are chips inside cars, there are chips in rockets and there are chips in unimaginable places. But chip designers are only a tiny fraction of the world population and are also located only in a few selected pockets of the world. The headcount of chip designers is so small, it is a miracle they are able to make an out-sized impact on the world. Every piece of modern machine contains chips in one form or another. Our life in the information age is underpinned by chips.  Even at the current level of technology the value added by chips is immense. So immense that most of the world population depends on it for healthy, happy and prosperous living.
Suppose, I tell you the number of chip designers can be increased by a factor of 100x and the number of electronics systems designed by a factor of 1000x, what wonders would come to pass? Is it even possible? Oh, Yes! We can.
Sadly, when older professions are fading away into history newer professions like chip design has a significant shortage of skilled people. Chip design is accessible to only a few people in the world. The design process is also far less efficient than what it can be. In this whitepaper,  I describe my ideas related to a hardware design ecosystem that is more efficient at producing useful hardware and also reward more people across the whole world. It is quite cumbersome to refer to hardware design engineers or ASIC design engineers or digital designers or RTL designers or IC designers or FPGA designers. It is also rather useless to add the term engineer to every job title. So,  I am naming this particular trade as chipping and the practitioner as a chipper.

FAQ
----
How can we support the Ehgu ecosystem?
You could start using open source code for your designs. You can donate code and documentation of your discontinued products. You can even open source your most important product to gain greater market credibility. You can remove the requirement for degree from your job postings. You can develop a curriculum for your company specific jobs that general public can self learn and then apply for your jobs. Chipping relies heavily on software tools. Some of the tools are prohibitively expensive. If you are a software developer creating Electronic Design Automation tools for design, try changing the model from a one time fully paid licensing to a Software as a Service model. Or better still, how about open sourcing your 5-10 year older version of your software? Or even provide a feature reduced version for education.
